# Data Exploration & Data Wrangling Laboratory

## Objectives
- Learn data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- Understand data normalization and data discretization.
- Develop skills to visualize data using Matplotlib.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x, Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy installed.
3. Place `students_data.csv` in the root directory.
4. Run the script `data_wrangling/main.py` to perform data exploration and wrangling tasks.

## Deliverables
